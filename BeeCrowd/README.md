### Name: [Salary](https://github.com/SabidMahmud/programming-problem-solving/blob/main/BeeCrowd/beginner/salary.c)
#### Description:
Write a program that reads an employee's number, his/her worked hours number in a month and the amount he received per hour. Print the employee's number and salary that he/she will receive at end of the month, with two decimal places.
<ul>
<li>Don’t forget to print the line's end after the result, otherwise you will receive “Presentation Error”.</li> 
  <li>Don’t forget the space before and after the equal signal and after the U$.</li>
</ul>

#### Input:
The input file contains 2 integer numbers and 1 value of floating point, representing the number, worked hours amount and the amount the employee receives per worked hour.

#### Output:
Print the number and the employee's salary, according to the given example, with a blank space before and after the equal signal.

### Name: [Salary with bonus](https://github.com/SabidMahmud/programming-problem-solving/blob/main/BeeCrowd/beginner/salary-with-bonus.c)
#### Description:
Make a program that reads a seller's name, his/her fixed salary and the sale's total made by himself/herself in the month (in money). Considering that this seller receives 15% over all products sold, write the final salary (total) of this seller at the end of the month , with two decimal places.
<ul>
<li>Don’t forget to print the line's end after the result, otherwise you will receive “Presentation Error”.</li>
  <li>Don’t forget the blank spaces.</li>
</ul>

#### Input:
The input file contains a text (employee's first name), and two double precision values, that are the seller's salary and the total value sold by him/her.

#### Output:
Print the seller's total salary, according to the given example.

<hr>

### Name: [Simple Calculate](https://github.com/SabidMahmud/programming-problem-solving/blob/main/BeeCrowd/beginner/simple-calculate.c)
#### Description:
In this problem, the task is to read a code of a product 1, the number of units of product 1, the price for one unit of product 1, the code of a product 2, the number of units of product 2 and the price for one unit of product 2. After this, calculate and show the amount to be paid.

#### Input
The input file contains two lines of data. In each line there will be 3 values: two integers and a floating value with 2 digits after the decimal point.

#### Output
The output file must be a message like the following example where "Valor a pagar" means Value to Pay. Remember the space after ":" and after "R$" symbol. The value must be presented with 2 digits after the point.

<hr>

### Name: [Sphere](https://github.com/SabidMahmud/programming-problem-solving/blob/main/BeeCrowd/beginner/sphere.c)
#### Description:
Make a program that calculates and shows the volume of a sphere being provided the value of its radius `(R)` . `The formula to calculate the volume is: (4/3) * pi * R^3`. Consider (assign) for `pi` the value `3.14159`.

> Tip: Use `(4/3.0)` or `(4.0/3)` in your formula, because some languages (including C++) assume that the division's result between two integers is another integer. :)

#### Input
The input contains a value of floating point (double precision).

#### Output
The output must be a message "VOLUME" like the following example with a space before and after the equal signal. The value must be presented with 3 digits after the decimal point.
